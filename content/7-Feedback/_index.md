### Overall Evaluation

**1. Working Environment**  
AWS offered the type of environment I imagined only after years in industry: ergonomic offices, quiet focus rooms, and tooling that actually works. What surprised me most was the **accessibility** of everyone around me. Senior engineers routinely paused to explain context, and managers encouraged me to ping them whenever I hit a wall. Hybrid flexibility also meant I could stay productive during deep-focus build days while still taking advantage of on-site collaboration.

Because the FCJ team treated curiosity as a strength, I asked far more questions than I normally would. With Sandbox accounts and AWS credits on hand, I spun up real infrastructure, broke it, and fixed it under guidance—something textbooks can’t replicate.

**2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin**  
My mentor coached rather than dictated. Whenever I brought a blocker, they nudged me toward the right AWS whitepaper or tool so I could reason through the solution myself. Highlights that stood out:

- **Weekly 1:1s** where we walked through demos, retros, and upcoming risks
- **Thorough code reviews** that emphasized readability, testability, and operational readiness
- **Architecture deep dives** so I understood trade-offs—not just the final diagram
- **Career roadmapping** advice covering certifications, portfolio focus, and next-step roles

Meanwhile, the admin crew cleared every logistical hurdle—from IAM requests to laptop support—before I even realized they existed. Their responsiveness let me stay locked in on shipping features.

**3. Relevance of Work to Academic Major**  
The Bandup IELTS initiative connected directly to my computer science curriculum yet stretched me into applied cloud engineering:

| Academic Knowledge Applied | New Skills Developed |
|---------------------------|---------------------|
| Python programming | AWS Lambda & serverless orchestration |
| Data structures & algorithms | RAG pipelines & vector search |
| Database fundamentals | DynamoDB, ElastiCache, data modeling |
| Networking basics | VPC design, subnetting, security controls |
| Software engineering | CI/CD automation, Infrastructure as Code |

Class projects rarely demand production SLAs or AI integrations. Owning Gemini audio flows and Titan embedding pipelines forced me to connect theory with real-world latency, throughput, and cost considerations.

**4. Learning & Skill Development Opportunities**  
FCJ layered structured learning with autonomy. Over twelve weeks I:

- **Touched 15+ AWS services** spanning compute, integration, data, and AI (Lambda, API Gateway, SQS, DynamoDB, S3, ECS, Fargate, Bedrock, etc.)
- **Owned end-to-end features** by scoping, implementing, testing, and deploying four Lambda functions
- **Practiced cost governance** and proved out the 72% savings from adopting Gemini’s native audio path
- **Documented extensively**, including this workshop so newcomers inherit a clear playbook
- **Experimented with AI/ML** integrations that immediately improved learner outcomes

Mentor checkpoints prevented me from drifting off course, yet I still had the autonomy to prototype ideas and learn through iteration.

**5. Company Culture & Team Spirit**  
Every Amazon Leadership Principle I’d read about showed up in day-to-day behavior. Examples:

- Teammates invested in my success, pairing with me late evenings to finish demos
- When I broke something, we ran blameless post-mortems and captured learnings instead of pointing fingers
- My suggestion to try Gemini’s native audio workflow wasn’t just heard—it became the baseline approach
- The “Day 1” mantra was more than a poster; people constantly asked how we could push Bandup further for students

Feeling like an actual contributor rather than an observer kept me fully engaged from week one.

**6. Internship Policies / Benefits**  
FCJ backed up its promises with tangible support:

- ✅ Stipend that respected the value of intern contributions
- ✅ Flex scheduling so I could juggle university commitments and deliverables
- ✅ Unlimited access to AWS Skill Builder, whitepapers, and internal tech talks
- ✅ Introductions to engineers across multiple orgs for career conversations
- ✅ Portfolio-ready work that I can demo to future employers

### Reflection Questions

**What did I find most satisfying during my internship?**

Shipping features that students can actually use. Watching the Speaking Evaluator ingest an audio file, run it through Gemini, and return band feedback via my Lambda pipeline was the moment everything clicked—my code made someone else’s learning easier.

**What could be improved for future interns?**

- **Faster AWS account provisioning** so interns can start building on day one
- **A structured onboarding kit** covering essential AWS concepts, CLI setup, and security do’s/don’ts
- **Cross-intern pairings** on shared initiatives to boost peer learning
- **Rotations or shadows** with other AWS teams to understand how FCJ fits into the broader organization

**Would I recommend this internship to friends?**

Without hesitation. If you love cloud engineering, FCJ offers:
- Direct access to AWS services and production patterns
- Mentors who invest in your growth
- Ownership over meaningful deliverables
- Resume-ready proof of your impact

All you need is curiosity and the willingness to put in focused effort.

### Suggestions & Future Expectations

**Ideas to further elevate FCJ:**

1. **Centralized intern playbook** with environment setup, troubleshooting tips, and sample architectures
2. **Show-and-tell sessions every other week** so interns can demo progress, receive feedback, and learn presentation skills
3. **Certification incentives** such as exam vouchers or study cohorts to encourage formal milestones
4. **FCJ alumni circle** that connects current interns with past participants for mentoring and career advice

**Would I like to stay involved?**

Absolutely. My goals include:
- Returning post-graduation as a cloud engineer or solutions architect
- Mentoring the next FCJ cohort to pass on lessons learned
- Continuing to refine the workshop content so future interns onboard faster

**Final thoughts**

FCJ reshaped how I think about building in the cloud. I entered with classroom knowledge and curiosity; I’m leaving with battle-tested workflows, stronger communication skills, and confidence in my ability to design secure, scalable systems. Thank you to everyone at AWS who invested in my journey. 🙏
