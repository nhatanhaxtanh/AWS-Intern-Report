### Week 7 Achievements

- Successfully completed **comprehensive review** of core AWS service groups: Compute, Storage, Networking, Database, Security (IAM).
- **Successfully practiced** numerous labs and multiple-choice questions on **AWS Builders** and **AWSboy** platforms.
- **Mastered** fundamental parameters of **EC2** (Instance Types, AMI, EBS volumes) and **S3** operations (Storage Classes, Object/Bucket management).
- **Clearly understood** relationships and configuration of components within a **VPC** (Public/Private Subnets, Routing, Security Groups vs NACLs).
- **Gained confidence** in knowledge acquired, ready for the upcoming mid-term exam.
- Created comprehensive study notes covering all major AWS service categories.
- Identified and addressed knowledge gaps through targeted practice sessions.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Security Groups are stateful (return traffic automatically allowed), NACLs are stateless (bidirectional rules required)
- EC2 instance types are optimized for different workloads (compute, memory, storage, GPU)
- S3 storage classes balance cost vs. access frequency requirements
- IAM policies follow explicit deny principle - most restrictive policy wins
- VPC routing follows most specific route match principle
