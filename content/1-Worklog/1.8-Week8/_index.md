### Week 8 Achievements

- **Completed the mid-term exam** (October 31st) successfully.
- **Successfully set up** basic development environment for the project with Python, AWS CLI, and IDE configuration.
- **Started building** initial **Create/Read** functionalities for the **Bandup IELTS** project using **AWS Lambda** and **DynamoDB**.
- **Researched and designed** serverless architecture pattern:
  - API Gateway for HTTP endpoints
  - Lambda functions for business logic
  - DynamoDB for NoSQL data storage
- **Reinforced knowledge** of essential Serverless services (Lambda, DynamoDB, API Gateway) critical for project development.
- Created initial project structure with proper directory organization.
- Implemented first Lambda function handler for Create operation.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Serverless architecture eliminates server management overhead
- Lambda functions are event-driven and scale automatically
- DynamoDB provides single-digit millisecond latency for NoSQL workloads
- API Gateway acts as the entry point for serverless APIs
- Proper project structure from the start simplifies future development
